# generative-toolbelt

Generative-toolbelt is a rich set of Clojure functions to ease out the process
of drawing and sketching with Quil. These are the function that I
personally use when I'm creating my artworks.

## Usage

At the moment the project is still under testing and tweaking since I
just made it splitting my original Quil sketch project into this
separate standalone library. When I'll complete the migration and it
will be stable I'll add it to Clojar and Leiningen.
