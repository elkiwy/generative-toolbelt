# generative-toolbelt

Generative-toolbelt is a rich set of Clojure functions to ease out the process
of drawing and sketching with Quil. These are the function that I
personally use when I'm creating my artworks.

## Usage

You can use the source as external files to import into your project,
or you can simply add this:

    [elkiwy/generative-toolbelt "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"]

to the dependencies in your `project.clj` file.
